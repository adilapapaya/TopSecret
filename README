Everything in here is top secret. If you are able to see it, it means I've granted you top secret high level security clearance so please don't abuse the priviledge. As you will probably be able to tell from browsing the repo, there is a lot of really top secret stuff in here that could be used for both good, and evil.

Example of an application for doing bad stuff:
Creating a Processing app that involves clicking on a point to detonate a nuclear weapon.

Example of an application for doing good stuff:
Creating a Processing app that involves clicking on a point to donate money to a Panda sanctuary in China.
