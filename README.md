# Top Secret


Everything in here is **top secret**. If you are able to see it, it means I've either granted you top secret high level security clearance *or* you are a world class hacker. 

As you will probably be able to tell from browsing the repo, there is a lot of really top secret stuff in here that could be used for both good and evil.

## Example of Apps for doing Bad Stuff

- app where clicking on a point will detonate a nuclear weapon.
- app where moving the mouse a certain amount will cause a catastropic earthquake.



## Example of Apps for doing Good Stuff

- app where clicking on a point donates money to a Panda sanctuary in China.
- app where moving the mouse a certain amount will clean up the environment by the same amount.
- app where a puppy gets adopted every time you even think of using it.
- app that will call your parents and tell them how much you love them if you press the top left of the screen.
- app that will call your parents and tell them how much you love them if you press anywhere on the screen.
